# Raven-Pioneer-Drone
 A Raspberry-Pi powered Quadcopter drone that is entirely custom made. This drone runs ArduPilot as its main Flight Controller and DroneKit as its flight computer and gateway to my upcoming AI network called IVEN. The goal is to build the Raven Pioneer as a proof of concept so I can later build the "Raven Flock" - a drone swarm for special missions.
